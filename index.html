      <img src="assets/Images/download.png" class="auth-image" alt="Jordan Beaman">

      <p>My past work history was mostly centered around customer service, sales, and hospitality. 
        Working for companies such as the Marriott, and Gamestop.
        I currently work as an Optometric Technician for Vision Source, and am very grateful for the opportunities I've been given there (like free Sporting KC games!)
         Ultimately, I'm hoping to gain enough experience from the program to finally get my foot in the door at a local tech company with like-minded people.

        In my free time, I love reading, meeting up with friends, watching sports, and playing video games.
        I'm a very big people-person, and I thrive on the personal connections I make from day to day</p>
